*Passenger Detection System using YOLOv5*


The Passenger Detection System is a project inspired by a real-life experience. The idea originated from an incident where an announcement on a bus mentioned that some passengers hadn't paid for their ride. This prompted curiosity about the technology behind such announcements, leading to the discovery that object detection, particularly the YOLOv5 model, was being used to address this issue.

This repository contains the code and resources for a basic automated system that detects the number of passengers within a bus using YOLOv5 and DataLoaders. While real-world scenarios might involve tracking passengers as they board and disembark from the bus, this specific example focuses on monitoring the number of passengers within the entire bus space, given the camera perspective provides comprehensive coverage.
